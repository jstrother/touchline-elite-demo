### **Testing Stack**

- **Test Runner:** Vitest (already configured)
- **Mocking:** Vitest mocks + MSW for API mocking
- **Database:** MongoDB Memory Server for isolation
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript strict mode + custom type guards
- **Assertions:** Vitest expect + custom domain matchers

## **📋 Implementation Steps**

### **Step 1: Test Foundation (Day 1)**

1. **Set up test database** (MongoDB Memory Server)
2. **Create test data factories** (typed fixtures)
3. **Configure domain-specific matchers**
4. **Establish testing utilities**

### **Step 2: Player Entity TDD (Days 2-3)**

1. **Write failing tests** for Player business rules
2. **Implement minimal Player entity** (type-safe)
3. **Add validation logic** driven by tests
4. **Refactor with proper types**

### **Step 3: Team & League TDD (Days 4-5)**

1. **Write failing tests** for Team/League relationships
2. **Implement entities** with proper associations
3. **Add business rule validation**
4. **Test league hierarchy logic**

### **Step 4: Fantasy Logic TDD (Days 6-8)**

1. **Write failing tests** for fantasy team rules
2. **Implement squad constraints** and validation
3. **Add scoring algorithm** with comprehensive tests
4. **Test transfer system** mechanics

### **Step 5: Integration Testing (Days 9-10)**

1. **Mock SportMonks API** responses
2. **Test data synchronization** flows
3. **Validate GraphQL schema** generation
4. **End-to-end user scenarios**

## **🎨 Example Test Structure**

```typescript
// Example: Fantasy Team Budget Tests
describe('FantasyTeam Budget Management', () => {
  describe('when creating a new fantasy team', () => {
    it('should start with standard budget of £100m', () => {
      const team = FantasyTeam.create({
        name: 'Test Team',
        userId: 'user-123',
        seasonId: 'season-456'
      });
      
      expect(team.budget).toBe(100.0);
      expect(team.remainingBudget).toBe(100.0);
    });
  });

  describe('when adding players to squad', () => {
    it('should deduct player cost from remaining budget', () => {
      const team = createFantasyTeam();
      const player = createPlayer({ price: 8.5 });
      
      team.addPlayer(player);
      
      expect(team.remainingBudget).toBe(91.5);
      expect(team.totalValue).toBe(8.5);
    });

    it('should prevent adding player if insufficient budget', () => {
      const team = createFantasyTeam({ remainingBudget: 5.0 });
      const expensivePlayer = createPlayer({ price: 8.5 });
      
      expect(() => team.addPlayer(expensivePlayer))
        .toThrow('Insufficient budget');
    });
  });
});
```
